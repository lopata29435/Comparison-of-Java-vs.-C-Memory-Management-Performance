/*
 * Conway's Game of Life, often referred to simply as the Game of Life, is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway in 1970.
 * It is a mathematical "zero-player" game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, with no further input required.
 *
 * The Game of Life is played on a 2D grid of cells, where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead (0 or 1).
 * The game progresses through generations, with the state of each cell in a generation being determined by the state of its neighboring cells
 * in the previous generation according to a set of rules. These rules are based on the concept of birth, death, and survival:
 * - Birth: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live.
 * - Death: A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors (underpopulation) or more than three live neighbors (overpopulation) becomes a dead cell.
 * - Survival: A live cell with two or three live neighbors remains alive.
 *
 * Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can produce complex and intricate patterns, including gliders (moving structures),
 * oscillators (repeating patterns), and even structures that can act as logic gates and memory cells.
 *
 * The benchmark involves several alternative strategies:
 * - Game of Life with Functional Programming
 * - Game of Life with Imperative Style
