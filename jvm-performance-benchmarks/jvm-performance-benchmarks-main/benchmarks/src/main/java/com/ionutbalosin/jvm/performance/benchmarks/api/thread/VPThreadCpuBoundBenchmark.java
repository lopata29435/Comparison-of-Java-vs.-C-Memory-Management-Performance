/*
 * This benchmark evaluates the performance of running CPU-bound (or CPU-intensive) tasks, which are
 * submitted to either a virtual thread executor service or a cached thread pool. Additionally,
 * various backoff strategies (e.g., thread parking, yield, or none) are triggered while running
 * CPU-bound tasks. These strategies may (or may not) unpin the virtual thread from its carrier.
 *
 * A configurable number of tasks are submitted to an executor using a burst approach, and the
 * benchmark awaits the completion of all these tasks. The executor is cached within the JMH state.
 * The level of parallelism for both platform and virtual threads is set to the same value to
 * facilitate an evaluation of their performance under comparable conditions. The benchmark method
 * accounts for the task submission cost to the initially idle executor, which, within the scope of
 * this specific use case, is deemed negligible.
 *
 * When a virtual thread executes CPU-bound code without involving any blocking I/O or other
 * blocking JDK methods, the virtual thread cannot be unmounted. Consequently, it will not yield and
 * may continue to occupy its carrier thread until it completes its computation. To address this,
 * the CPU-bound tasks include explicit various backoff strategies (such as yielding, or parking) in
 * an attempt to de-schedule the running thread and permit other threads to execute on the CPU,
 * thereby facilitating the unmounting of the virtual thread from its carrier.
 *
 * Note: When the workload is CPU-bound, virtual threads may not offer a substantial improvement
 * in application throughput compared to traditional platform threads. Additionally, in scenarios of
 * CPU-bound workloads, having significantly more threads than processor cores does not necessarily
 * enhance throughput. As a side note, using virtual threads solely for heavy in-memory processing
 * may not align with their intended use case.
