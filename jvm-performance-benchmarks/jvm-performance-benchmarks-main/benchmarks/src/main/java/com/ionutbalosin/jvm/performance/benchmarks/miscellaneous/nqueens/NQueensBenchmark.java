/*
 * The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens can attack each other.
 * This problem is computationally intensive, and its duration is directly proportional to the chessboard size
 * (i.e., the larger the chessboard, the more time it takes to compute the solutions).
 * The benchmark utilizes two alternative approaches to solve the N-Queens problem:
 * - Backtracking
 * - Simulated Annealing
 *
 * Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy.
 * It is used for solving combinatorial optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution among a large set of possible solutions.
 * It starts with an initial solution and iteratively explores neighboring solutions, gradually reducing the "temperature"
 * (a parameter that controls the probability of accepting worse solutions).
 *
 * Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to systematically explore all possible solutions to a problem by incrementally building
 * a solution and undoing incorrect choices if they lead to dead-ends. It explores all possible paths in the solution space,
 * pruning those that violate problem constraints, to find a feasible or optimal solution.
 *
 * Note: Simulated Annealing does not guarantee an optimal solution, unlike Backtracking, which guarantees to find the exact solution if it exists.
 *
 * The performance of Simulated Annealing versus Backtracking can vary significantly based on the choice of parameters, cooling schedule, N-size, etc. Example:
 * - for a smaller N (e.g., N=8; i.e., a typical 8x8 chessboard size), Backtracking is capable of finding all possible solutions relatively quickly.
 * - for a larger N (e.g., N=64, i.e., 64x64 chessboard size), the search space becomes astronomically large, making it less practical for Backtracking to explore all configurations.
 * In such cases, Simulated Annealing may become more practical, as it can efficiently explore the search space but without guaranteeing an optimal solution.
